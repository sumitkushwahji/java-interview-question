## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concept in java

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes for organizing and structuring code. Java is an object-oriented programming language, and it embodies the fundamental OOP concepts. These concepts help in creating well-structured, modular, and reusable code. The core OOP concepts in Java include:

### Class:

A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the properties (fields/attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects created from the class will have.
```
public class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name);
    }
}
```
